There is nothing to do but memorize it. In the case of 今月, the reading is こんげつ (kongetsu), which is at least a standard on'yomi reading for both kanji. You'd think that would make 今月 easier to remember. However, I think the visual similarity it shares with 今日 is causing me to trip over it as if 今月 <em>also</em> had an exceptional reading.</p>\n<p>In other news, I've joined tokiniandy.com to assist with studying the Genki textbooks. It seems useful so far, but I haven't gone through too many of the lessons yet. We'll see how it goes.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, I appreciate that both WaniKani and ToKini Andy seem to have very active and helpful communities.</p>",

Remembering the meaning of the radicals/kanji/vocab has (so far) been fairly easy. I've had to focus much harder on the readings. Counting things/people/days/months/etc. tripped me up quite a bit. Knowing when to use which reading of a number has been a bit of a struggle, but I finally feel like I'm getting it right almost every time.</p>\n<p>There is a local chapter of the National Association fo Japan-America Societies in my city that offers Japanese language classes. They are (understandably) not inexpensive, but I may consider trying one at some point, if only for the conversation and listening practice I would gain.</p>",
