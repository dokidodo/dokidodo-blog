Anyway...</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I'm using this site to track my progress while I learn Japanese. It is unlikely that many other people will read it. But, my thought is that things will stick in my head more firmly if I write about them. So, here we are.</p>\n<p>So far, I've learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kana (hiragana and katakana).\n<ul>\n<li>I used a combination of an app on my phone and a game called \"You Can Kana\" for PC (highly recommended for complete beginners).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>~65 kanji.\n<ul>\n<li>Mostly using WaniKani.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>~125 vocabulary words.\n<ul>\n<li>Also mostly with WaniKani.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Grammar basics (just started) using:\n<ul>\n<li>Tae Kim's Grammar Guide</li>\n<li>Genki I</li>\n<li>Bunpro</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've also tried out a (zero) graded reader and, while having only 125 words/65 kanji under my belt means I still need to look up most of the words, I think it has been a useful exercise.</p>",
