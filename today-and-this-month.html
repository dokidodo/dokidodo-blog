In the case of 今月, the reading is こんげつ (kongetsu), which is at least a standard on'yomi reading for both kanji. You'd think that would make 今月 easier to remember. However, I think the visual similarity it shares with 今日 is causing me to trip over it as if 今月 also had an exceptional reading. In other news, I've joined tokiniandy.com to assist with studying the Genki textbooks. It seems useful so far, but I haven't gone through too many of the lessons yet. We'll see how it goes.
