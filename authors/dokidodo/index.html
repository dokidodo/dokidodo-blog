It took over a month. Two things happened to slow my progression down: That said, I've decided to not pay much (or any) attention to how long each level takes me. While I enjoy seeing those stats, being hard on myself because I'm not moving through the levels as quickly as I'd like to (or as quickly as others in the WaniKani community seem to) isn't useful. As long as I continue to learn and make progress, I think that's enough for me.</p><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/wanikani-level-6.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-18T10:53" class="feed__date">June 18, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/wanikani-level-5.html">WaniKani Level 5</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>This post is a little late since I've been on Level 5 for several days now, but that's how it goes. It took me quite a long time to get through Level 4. I don't think the reason for that is low accuracy. I don't feel like I was making more mistakes than usual and the stats don't seem to indicate that. Speaking of stats: You can see how much longer Level 4 took me than previous levels: I'm hoping to speed things up for Level 5 and beyond, but we'll see what happens. So far there isn't anything at this level that's giving me a lot of trouble. I'm mostly hesitant to do too many lessons at once so I don't end up with hundreds of reviews all landing at the same time in the future.</p><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/wanikani-level-5.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-03T20:47" class="feed__date">June 3, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/today-i-learned-1.html">Today I Learned - 1</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>I doubt I'll do this with everything, but I'd like to start recording some of the Japanese I learn, as I learn it.

For 今日, the reading is きょう (kyou) and is a complete exception. There is nothing to do but memorize it. In the case of 今月, the reading is こんげつ (kongetsu), which is at least a standard on'yomi reading for both kanji. You'd think that would make 今月 easier to remember. However, I think the visual similarity it shares with 今日 is causing me to trip over it as if 今月 also had an exceptional reading. In other news, I've joined tokiniandy.com to assist with studying the Genki textbooks. It seems useful so far, but I haven't gone through too many of the lessons yet. We'll see how it goes. If nothing else, I appreciate that both WaniKani and ToKini Andy seem to have very active and helpful communities.</p><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/today-and-this-month.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-05-19T21:41" class="feed__date">May 19, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/wanikani-level-4.html">WaniKani Level 4</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>I crossed into level four on WaniKani today. According to my stats, I've learned 80 radicals, 80 kanji, and 124 vocabulary words. I started with WaniKani 32 days ago. It's certainly not the fastest progression I've seen, but I'm very happy with where I'm at. Full stats: I'm also pretty satisfied with my accuracy. Remembering the meaning of the radicals/kanji/vocab has (so far) been fairly easy. I've had to focus much harder on the readings. Counting things/people/days/months/etc. tripped me up quite a bit. Knowing when to use which reading of a number has been a bit of a struggle, but I finally feel like I'm getting it right almost every time. There is a local chapter of the National Association fo Japan-America Societies in my city that offers Japanese language classes. They are (understandably) not inexpensive, but I may consider trying one at some point, if only for the conversation and listening practice I would gain.</p><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/wanikani-level-4.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-05-16T21:25" class="feed__date">May 16, 2022</time></div><h2><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/first-post.html">一つ</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>I'm bad at first posts. Is there such a thing as a good "first post" to anything? Anyway... I'm using this site to track my progress while I learn Japanese. It is unlikely that many other people will read it. But, my thought is that things will stick in my head more firmly if I write about them. So, here we are. So far, I've learned: I've also tried out a (zero) graded reader and, while having only 125 words/65 kanji under my belt means I still need to look up most of the words, I think it has been a useful exercise.</p><a href="http://www.dokidodo.com/first-post.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.dokidodo.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
