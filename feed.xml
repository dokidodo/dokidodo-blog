                    I crossed into level four on WaniKani today. According to my stats, I've learned 80 radicals, 80 kanji, and 124 vocabulary words. I started with WaniKani 32 days ago. It's certainly not the fastest progression I've seen, but I'm very happy with where I'm at.

<p>I'm also pretty satisfied with my accuracy. Remembering the meaning of the radicals/kanji/vocab has (so far) been fairly easy. I've had to focus much harder on the readings. Counting things/people/days/months/etc. tripped me up quite a bit. Knowing when to use which reading of a number has been a bit of a struggle, but I finally feel like I'm getting it right almost every time.</p>
<p>There is a local chapter of the National Association fo Japan-America Societies in my city that offers Japanese language classes. They are (understandably) not inexpensive, but I may consider trying one at some point, if only for the conversation and listening practice I would gain.</p>

<p>I'm using this site to track my progress while I learn Japanese. It is unlikely that many other people will read it. But, my thought is that things will stick in my head more firmly if I write about them. So, here we are.</p>
<p>So far, I've learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kana (hiragana and katakana).
<ul>
<li>I used a combination of an app on my phone and a game called "You Can Kana" for PC (highly recommended for complete beginners).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~65 kanji.
<ul>
<li>Mostly using WaniKani.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~125 vocabulary words.
<ul>
<li>Also mostly with WaniKani.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grammar basics (just started) using:
<ul>
<li>Tae Kim's Grammar Guide</li>
<li>Genki I</li>
<li>Bunpro</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also tried out a (zero) graded reader and, while having only 125 words/65 kanji under my belt means I still need to look up most of the words, I think it has been a useful exercise.</p>
