<p>I'm using this site to track my progress while I learn Japanese. It is unlikely that many other people will read it. But, my thought is that things will stick in my head more firmly if I write about them. So, here we are.</p>
<p>So far, I've learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kana (hiragana and katakana).
<ul>
<li>I used a combination of an app on my phone and a game called "You Can Kana" for PC (highly recommended for complete beginners).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~65 kanji.
<ul>
<li>Mostly using WaniKani.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~125 vocabulary words.
<ul>
<li>Also mostly with WaniKani.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grammar basics (just started) using:
<ul>
<li>Tae Kim's Grammar Guide</li>
<li>Genki I</li>
<li>Bunpro</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also tried out a (zero) graded reader and, while having only 125 words/65 kanji under my belt means I still need to look up most of the words, I think it has been a useful exercise.</p>
